      "üôèüèª I'm so thankful for my team. We won the Langara College Web & Mobile App Development Capstone presentation!",
      "I'm thrilled to announce that Learnium, the mobile application we've poured our hearts and skills into, has won Langara College's Web & Mobile App Development Capstone presentation! üéâü•á",
      "Learnium, helps students learn better by turning passive content into interactive experiences with generative AI technology. This idea came from my own personal struggle with reading a book. I found that I learned new topics better when it was interactive, like taking quizzes and memorizing terms with flashcards, compared to just reading alone.",
      "Over the past three months, as the project manager and full-stack developer, I've had an incredible journey of learning and growth. We dove into various technologies - React Native for our front end, Node.js with Express for the backend, and integrating OpenAI API with LangChain to craft our own vector database. This allowed us to convert books into dynamic, interactive experiences, including flashcards and quizzes. Plus, Learnium breaking down complex content into digestible topics and generating personalized study schedules based on exam dates has made learning more effective.",
      "This success wouldn't have been possible without the fantastic minds and dedication of our designers and developers - Nahla Niavarani, Pablo Montoya Varela, Vaibhav Malhotra, Wakana Kaneiwa, Mario Cesena, Edgar Velandia, and Ievgeniia (Genia) Chornobai. Working alongside such talented people like you has been an absolute pleasure.",

      "I want to extend gratitude to Tyler Higgs, our exceptional instructor this semester, and all my past instructors at Langara College. Their guidance and imparted knowledge have prepared me for the journey ahead as a developer.",
