      "I'm thrilled to announce that Learnium, the mobile application we've poured our hearts and skills into, has won Langara College's Web & Mobile App Development Capstone presentation! üéâü•á",
      "Learnium, helps students learn better by turning passive content into interactive experiences with generative AI technology. This idea came from my own personal struggle with reading a book. I found that I learned new topics better when it was interactive, like taking quizzes and memorizing terms with flashcards, compared to just reading alone.",
      "Over the past three months, as the project manager and full-stack developer, I've had an incredible journey of learning and growth. We dove into various technologies - React Native for our front end, Node.js with Express for the backend, and integrating OpenAI API with LangChain to craft our own vector database. This allowed us to convert books into dynamic, interactive experiences, including flashcards and quizzes. Plus, Learnium breaking down complex content into digestible topics and generating personalized study schedules based on exam dates has made learning more effective.",
      "This success wouldn't have been possible without the fantastic minds and dedication of our designers and developers - Nahla Niavarani, Pablo Montoya Varela, Vaibhav Malhotra, Wakana Kaneiwa, Mario Cesena, Edgar Velandia, and Ievgeniia (Genia) Chornobai. Working alongside such talented people like you has been an absolute pleasure.",

      "I want to extend gratitude to Tyler Higgs, our exceptional instructor this semester, and all my past instructors at Langara College. Their guidance and imparted knowledge have prepared me for the journey ahead as a developer.",

      "I recently grew my interest in Vancouver real estate market and decided to create a data visualization project using React, Express JS, MapBox, OpenAI, and Langchain.",
      "I got this dataset for real estate sales in Vancouver from 2023. I designed it to have 4 main sections: Snapshot, Map & Table with filtering and sorting, Trend, and ChatBot.",
      "The Snapshot section gives a quick overview of the total transactions, average price, average price per sq.ft, and most/least active month. I create a custom hook to pre-process the data and calculate the average price per sq.ft. for each property type and sort the transaction by month.",
      "For the Map & Table section, I use MapBox to render the map and customize the popup to show the property details. The table is sortable and filterable by property type, price, and size. I render the marker to only show the property that inside the bounds of the maps to improve the performance. However, I run into a performance issue when the map is zoomed out and the number of markers is too many. Thank to my mentor who give me a feedback to use cluster strategy. By grouping the marker in the nearby area into cluster, this technic improve the performance by night and day.",
      "The Trend section shows average price per sq.ft for each property type over the year.",
      "The ChatBot section is powered by OpenAI and Langchain. I embedded the data to create a vector database for AI to be able to search for the answer. The ChatBot will only give answer based on the provided dataset.",

      "Excited to share my latest personal project: Canadian PR Notification! üá®üá¶",

      "This project started as a way for me to learn more about AWS services I hadn‚Äôt used before, beyond EC2 and S3, which I used in my college projects (Learnium, DEALicious). But I also wanted it to be practical‚Äîsomething I‚Äôd personally find useful.",

      "The idea came when I realized I was following several Twitter and Instagram accounts for Canadian immigration updates, specifically for news on PR draws. Then it hit me: Why not create a tool that delivers these updates directly to my email?",

      "Here‚Äôs how I tackled it:",

      "Initially, I planned to build an Express.js server deployed on AWS Lambda, triggered by API Gateway. The API would be called periodically using AWS EventBridge to check IRCC's website, compare the data with the latest entry in my MongoDB database, and, if new, send emails to subscribers using SendGrid.",

      "However, I quickly discovered that EventBridge doesn‚Äôt support HTTP requests like CRON jobs do (a method I‚Äôm more familiar with from my current job).",

      "This led me to refactor the project into two repositories:",

      "A function that fetches the latest announcements from IRCC‚Äôs website.",
      "An Express.js server that creates an API to allow users to subscribe.",
      "It‚Äôs been a great learning experience to explore new AWS services and refine the architecture along the way. The project is far from perfect, but I‚Äôm proud of its progress.",
